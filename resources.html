              <p>In this page, you can find some of my favorite resources. Keep in mind I used them before, so you can trust me a bit! I have separated them in 3 different sections. The first section contains resources UCF has to offer. The second section contains class related resources. Finally, the last section contains anything related to life! I hope you enjoy these resources as much as I do.<br><br>Perla Del Castillo</p>

                <p class="nice-bold">Health Center at UCF</p>
                <p> This is an excellent resource on campus. Many people don't know about it, but yes, appointments here are covered in your tuiton. Therefore, they are free! When it comes to medical exams, you might need to have your insurance in file, but other than that, consultations are free. Click <a href="http://shs.sdes.ucf.edu/" target="_blank">here</a> to find out more information.</p><br>
                <p class="nice-bold">CAPS - Counseling and Psychological Services</p>
                <p> If you are struggling with classes, have any family problems, or you just don't know what you are doing, then I would recommend considering this resource. With CAPS, you can find the help you need. A certain amount of sessions is covered in your tuiton. I used this service before and I am sure it helped me a bunch.

                 <p class="nice-bold">LEARN - Learning Environment and Academic Research Network</p>
                <p>Interested in doing research? If you are thinking "yes" or even "maybe", then this is the right place to start looking into it. LEARN is a program within the Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) that focuses on research opportunities for STEM majors. I was part of LEARN in the 2016-2017 cohort and today I am a peer mentor for this program. Within this program, I was able to be part of a small community. It definitely helped in my first year at UCF. Click <a href="https://our.ucf.edu/learn/" target="_blank">here</a> to see what LEARN has to offer!</p><br>
